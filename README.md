Practicing to get the GeoQuiz app in place. The idea is TextView Displays different question from the questions added as dataList as the Next Button is pressed. Added OnClickListener to the TextView. 

Learnings:
1. Layout Structuring
2. How the Data Can be encapsulated in the Data Class
3. View model class created to store UI related data
4. Moved the business logic from Activity class to its own viewmodel
5. Created a seperate Horizontal layout. So the view gets arranged as per the horizontal payout when the screen oritentation is landscape mode
6. Explored Concept of LiveData, SaveStateHandle. This part was super fun!
7. Tested  the app in split screen. Android 13 and above seems to get the muti screen capabillity or multiresume capability for free with zero code. 

**Previous and Next button Works**
